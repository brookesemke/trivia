# Riddle Me This…
A quiz game with attitude.

## Project Description
Riddle Me This… is a mobile-first quiz game that pulls 10 random questions based on topics the user selects.

Once a player selects a topic, the app displays the first question and starts a visible timer for 10 seconds. If the timer reaches 5 seconds, the app starts throwing a little attitude and a “hurry up” message is shown. If the player does not answer the question in the alloted time, a "Time's Up" gif is displayed, and a continue button is shown. 

If the player answers the question within the allotted amount of time, the app displays a GIF that corresponds to the a right or wrong answer. At the end of the game, the user score is shown along with an awesome Chuck Norris gif. The last score is saved and shown to the user before starting a new game.

Before starting the game, user is shown a welcome screen introducing the team behind Riddle Me This...
