# Riddle Me This…

## Project Description
A quiz game with attitude.

Riddle Me This… is a quiz game that pulls random questions based on topics the user selects.
Riddle Me This… is a timed quiz game that throws attitude the longer the player takes to answer a question.

1. Player enters name (must)
2. Player selects a topic (must)

Once a player selects a topic Riddle Me This… displays the first question and starts a visible timer.
The timer is set for 30 seconds. If the player lets the timer reach 10 seconds a “hurry up” gif is shown.
If the player lets the timer reach 5 seconds an “oh no” gif is shown.
If the player does not answer the question a “boo” gif is shown, and a continue button is shown.

IF the player answers the question within the allotted amount of time, the player is shown either:
Right answer “way to go” gif
Wrong answer “nope” gif

The player will answer 10 questions and a scoring system will give the player (this could come after the MVP)
10 points for answering the question before 15 seconds
5 points for after 15 seconds
Deduct 5 points for a wrong answer
Deduct 10 points for no answer 

At the end of the game…
Points are tallied and:
Perfect score gets a “wow amazing” gif
8 to 9 right answers gets a “well done” gif
6 to 7 right answers gets a “not bad” gif
1 to 5 right answers gets a “well you tried” gif
And no right answers get a chuck Norris quote.

A “want to play again?” Button will also be displayed along with the final gif and score.
