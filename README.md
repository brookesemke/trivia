# Riddle Me This…

## Project Description
A quiz game with attitude.

Riddle Me This… is a quiz game that pulls 10 random questions based on topics the user selects.
Riddle Me This… is a timed quiz game that throws attitude the longer the player takes to answer a question.

Once a player selects a topic Riddle Me This… displays the first question and starts a visible timer.
The timer is set for 10 seconds. If the player lets the timer reach 10 seconds a “hurry up” message is shown.
If the player does not answer the question in the alloted time, a "Time's Up" gif is displayed, and a continue button is shown. If the player answers the question within the allotted amount of time, the app displays a GIF that corresponds to the a right or wrong answer.

At the end of the game, the user score is shown along with an awesome Chuck Norris gif. The last score is saved and shown to the user before starting a new game.
